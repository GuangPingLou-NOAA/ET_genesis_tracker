The program that extracts storm tracks from model forecasts are being upgraded in order to accommodate newly implemented GEFS changes and replacing input GRIB1 data with GRIB2 data where available. 

v3.3.3 - Released November 28, 2012
Initial transition to WCOSS 

v3.3.4 - Released August 20, 2013
Navy model name changes from ngps to nvgm 

v3.4.0 - Released April 1, 2015
Made changes to the FORTRAN code so that it can read either GRIB1 or GRIB2  model input data.  

Modified scripts to include GRIB1 and GRIB2 options; as well as namelist that reflects changes to the input data format; The following models have the options of either GRIB1 or GRIB2 input: GFS, GEFS, NAM, SREF, FENS, NVGM, UKMET. Other models do not have the GRIB2 data.

Added FNMOC ensemble cyclone tracks. The new addition has 20 members in total and the tracker runs twice a day at 00z and 12z. The tracker reads in GRIB1 input data because there is no analysis (0hour) fields in GRIB2 format. When 0 hour analysis data become available, the tracker can switch the GRIB2 input data on.

SREF new members addition in anticipation of its impending implementation. Reduced perturbation models from 3 to 2. Increased number of members from 21 to 26. Added GRIB2 capability. This implementation still uses GRIB1 input data until SREF is upgraded.

Deleted gettrk_main_gen.fd/orders.f because libw3 already contains the subroutine. 

Using new version of g2_d library.

output changes (include all changes to output generated by this tracker): 

Forecast tracks every 6 hours instead of 12 hours for models ECMWF, CMC, CENS, NVGM, because of 6 hourly data become available.

compute resource information (mandatory!  Include for all jobs.

Initiate FNMOC FENS ensemble forecasts cyclone tracking. Start a JTRACKER twice a day at 07:40 and 19:40Z for 00Z and 12Z forecasts, respectively. The ensemble data arrive around 07:21 and 17:21.

All other jobs remain the same frequency and same start time as they are now.

job runs parallel in form of POE (MPMD)

Runtime does not change.

additional disk space required per day (30MB/day).

frequency of run remain the same..

Data retains for files in /com/hur/prod/global/yyyy and the same as before. 

pre-implementation testing requirements

All model data should be tested as input for the cyclone tracker. production jobs should be tested as part of this implementation

This change does not require a 30-day evaluation.

The code manager will exam the test results.

Dissemination info:
where should this output be sent: N/A. The data will be processed internally and disseminated via graphics and paired tracks to users in other crontab jobs.  

who are the users: general public, universities, service centers, etc.

output files in /com/hur/prod/global/$yyyy should be transferred from PROD WCOSS to DEV WCOSS.

Is the code proprietary and is there any restricted data: The code is not proprietary and the data is not restricted except for ECMWF data which is protected via a pre-approval procedure.

v3.4.5 - Oct 14, 2016
For phase 2 path change in NAM upgrade 

v3.4.7 -March 8, 2018
Service Change Notes:  Extratropical Cyclone Tracker genesis_tracker.v3.4.7
The program that extracts storm tracks from model forecasts are being upgraded in order to replace input data from Canadian models CMC and CENS.
The tracker is activated to extract tracks from CMC and CENS twice a day.
Canadian deterministic and ensemble models (CMC and CENS) data have been changed to grib2 format and higher resolution. The data locations have been moved to /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/com/naefs/$envir/cmce.$PDY/$CYC/pgrb2ap5/ and /dcomdev/us007003/$PDY/wgrbbul/cmc_gdps_25km /. The tracker needs to be modified accordingly.
